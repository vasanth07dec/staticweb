        <p>
          We provide free academic assessment for every child, to understand
          their academic progress and match them to our enrichment classes that
          will benefit the child the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our assessment recognises that each child is unique, and with our
          individualised assessments we can help identify students diverse
          learning styles, strengths, and needs.
